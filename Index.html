        <h2>My Biography</h2>
        <p> My name is Alvine Ndege ,a young teacher based in Nairobi, Kenya.I'm passionate about software development and technology and how they can be used to better the education of the African child.I have a rich background in I.C.T integration in the classroom setting with over five years of experience in classroom facilitation and instruction.

            My journey into tech was piqued at a young age, inspired by a curiosity about how things work. This spurred me to start tinkering with anything tech related and this is where I developed a strong intrest in programming, problem-solving, and system design.
            
            Over the years, I've worked with various teams and fellow educators and contributed to various projects. When I'm not coding, I enjoy mentoring aspiring young tech enthusiasts, exploring new technologies, and participating in open-source communities.
            
            I believe in the power of technology to transform lives and i am committed to building solutions that make a meaningful impact on the African and Kenyan education landscape.</p>

        <h2>Why I Joined the Program</h2>
        <p>I joined the program for a variety of reasons. The modern landscape of learning is constantly changing and new learning methods are being implemented worldwide.As a teacher,technology provides a platform through which i can empower the disenfranchised African learner to make them competitive in the modern world. I believe the program will equip me with crucial tools that will greatly boosts my content delivery in and out of classroom. Below, i have briefly listed a few reason why i joined the program :</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Enhance Accessibility:</strong> I believe by collaborating with other stakeholders, whichever tools i will be able to build will enhance accessibility of content and learning resources to the learners.</li>
            <li><strong>Improve Efficiency:</strong>Technology is meant to make our work easy,technological tools improve learning and teaching and make it easier for educational facilitators to assess whether learning has taken place easily especially where the learner-teacher ratio is unequal</li>
            <li><strong>Facilitate Learning:</strong>I am a stronger believer that Education is a great equalizer, and technology is just but a tool that will raise the general IQ of the entire human race .Learning tools,resources,content and assignments can be uploaded on a webpage and learners will be able to access the materials at their own free time and learn at a pace that favours their learning style  .</li>
        </ul>
